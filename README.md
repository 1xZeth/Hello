### 👤 About Me

I’m a 21-year-old full-stack developer and cybersecurity engineer with over 6 years of software development experience and 9 years immersed in offensive and defensive security. My expertise spans IoT security, reverse engineering, and advanced networking — grounded in deep knowledge of Linux environments, low-level system analysis, and secure infrastructure design.

I thrive at the protocol layer, building and breaking high-performance systems with security integrated from the kernel upward.
